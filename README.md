# Netention
Network Attention + Intention = Netention

Netention is a decentralized, NodeJS-based social media, geographic information systems (GIS) mapping, and data visualization project.  What makes this project unique is our post model: the Nobject (networked object). A Nobject is essentially a collection of networked objects: photos, videos, website URLs, files from your device, online maps, spreadsheets, and databases; the possibilities are endless.  Nobjects can contain any number and type of Nobjects: temporary or permanent, local or online, with as many sub-containers (Nobjects) as you like.  Each Nobject has the possibility of being downloaded to a .nob file which can be sent and viewed offline.  Nobjects are served via a torrent-style network of nodes.  Nobjects are visualized in four data views by default: feed (Twitter, Facebook), map (2D and 3D globe), timeline, and graph (relational visualization).

Netention users choose their attention (Focus) by selecting a Nobject, selecting from categories (Facets, Filters), or using the search box. Once an attention or intention (Focus) is set the four data views are populated. If you select a Nobject in a data view and set it as your focus the data views will reset and repopulate, and your navigation history will be represented in a tree to easily return to your original focus (or any level above and below).
